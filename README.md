![Showcase of Space Raid 2](https://github.com/Klehrik/Space-Raid-2/assets/78520710/7dfd947f-640f-4401-981b-839fe1e17179)


A sequel to [Space Raid](https://klehrik.itch.io/space-raid).  

The font used is a slightly edited version of Theoretical by [somepx](https://somepx.itch.io/) (support their work [here](https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-tiny)!)
I also used the [Input](https://offalynne.github.io/Input/#/6.1/) library.
